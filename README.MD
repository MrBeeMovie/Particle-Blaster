# README

Welcome to my original game Particle Blaster.

This project was made to develop a game in Unity Game Engine with 2D lighting and wave based mechanics.

The game currently runs on Windows OS. All working builds of the game can be found in the builds directory.

# Controls

To move use WASD and to shoot press the left mouse button.
